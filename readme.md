# TS Fundamentals

This is a small project built with the intention of sharing and presenting the foundations of Typescript.

## How to run it?

First run to install all dependencies
```
npm i
```

Run the following in your terminal to transpile and give a look to the generated JS code
```
tsc
```

The package.json include some scripts to run the TS files directly
```
npm run primitives
npm run classes
npm run utility     
```

## Some good practices
* include your ./dist or output folder in the .gitignore file
* install TS as a dev dependency
